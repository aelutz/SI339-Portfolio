    <div id="adoption-intro">

    <p>There are plenty of options for adopting a cat. Below, we will take a deeper dive into a few of these options.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="friends-and-family">
    <h2>Friends and Family</h2>
    <p>It feels like I always know someone who is giving away kittens! Adopting a cat that needs a home from a friend or a family member is a great way to keep cats out of the humane societies or off the streets. <a href="https://www.petco.com/content/petco/PetcoStore/en_US/pet-services/resource-center/adoption-rescue/Know-Your-Pet-Adoption-Options.html">Petco</a> recommends "...before taking home any pet, be sure to ask about shot, health and microchip records and whether the animal is spayed or neutered, and ask for copies of any veterinary records so you can stay on top of or get ahead of health issues."</p>
  </div>

  <div id="shelters">
    <h2>Animal Shelters and Humane Societies</h2>
    <p>
      Animal Shelters and Humane Societies generally have an abundance of cats waiting to be adopted. Unfortunately, these shelters cannot keep animals for a very long time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When you adopt a cat from a shelter, there is generally an adoption fee ranging from $15 to a few hundred dollars. Depending on the shelter, you will be asked to fill out paperwork about your lifestyle and home. Even more, the shelter may require that an employee from the shelter do a home visit before you can bring a pet home. If you decide to adopt a cat from a shelter, I recommend calling ahead to the shelter of your choosing to learn their adoption process.

      To search for a shelter in your area, check out the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/adopt-pet/find-shelter">ASPCA</a> site.

  <div id="adoption-sites">
    <h2>Adoption Websites</h2>
    <p>
      Adoption sites allow you to filter your cat search. You can generally filter by location, price, age, breed, and more.
