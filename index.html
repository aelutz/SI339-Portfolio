      <p> Adopting a cat is a big commitment. The average life expectancy of an indoor cat is 10-15 years. Here are some things you should know before bringing a feline friend into your home:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cats and other animals are territorial.</strong> If you already have cats or other pets at home, make sure you have the space in your home to separate the new cat from the other animals. The new cat should have its own space and be introduced to the other pets incrementally over a period of time. It's difficult to say how long it will take for your pets to get used to the new cat. You'll have to judge that on your own, but make sure to not leave the new cat out overnight until you're certain it is safe with your other pets.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Supplies you'll need:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li><em>A litter box and litter.</em> It's recommended that there is one litter boxper the number of cats in your home. You may need to experiment with which kind of litter your cat likes best. For example, there are non-clumping and clumping litters as well as scented and unscented.</li>
              <li><em>Food.</em> You'll need to do some research to decide what kind and what brand of food you should feed your cat. There are several factors like the age of your cat that will help inform your decision. Here are some general guidelines from <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>"If you’re responsible for taking care of kittens in the first few months of their lives, you should be prepared to move them from a diet of milk to regular kitten food."</li>
                <li>"Adult cats should eat enough of a high-quality, nutritious food to meet their energy needs and to maintain and repair body tissues. The amount you feed your adult cat should be based on his or her size and energy output. Activity levels vary dramatically between pets and will play an important role in determining caloric intake."</li>
                <li>"Cats begin to show visible age-related changes at about seven to twelve years of age. There are metabolic, immunologic and body composition changes, too. Some of these are unavoidable. Others can be managed with diet."</li>
                <li>"Obesity is an extremely common problem in pets and, as with humans, can be detrimental to the health of a cat. The overweight pet has many added stresses upon his body and is at an increased risk of diabetes, liver problems and joint pain."</li>
              </ul>
              <li><em>A collar.</em> If you plan on letting your cat outdoors at all, it is a good idea to get your cat a collar with tags that have your contact information. If not, and your cat gets out of the house, people might mistake your cat as a stray cat. Then, they might either take the cat into their own home or into the humane society. </li>
              <li><em>Toys.</em> You'll want something to keep your cat entertained! You should be able to find a feather wand, laser pointer, and cat-nip filled plushies at the nearest pet store. It's important to know though that a crumpled up receipt may keep your cat just as entertained as any store-bought toy.</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          <li><strong>The cost.</strong> The estimated average cost of taking care of a cat is <a href="https://www.petcoach.co/article/cost-of-owning-a-cat/#:~:text=While%20the%20actual%20cost%20of,cost%20of%20%247%2C646%20to%20%2412%2C500.">$809 per year.</a> Make sure this cost is within your annual budget. It's also a good idea to set aside a little more than this in case of emergencies or if your cat gets sick. </li>
